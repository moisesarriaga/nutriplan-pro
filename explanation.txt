I have successfully adjusted the scrollbar for the text area as you requested. I modified the styles in the `index.html` file to make the scrollbar appear more centered.

I have verified that the changes are correctly applied.

I intended to add a test to ensure the quality of the change, but I found no testing framework (like Jest or React Testing Library) set up in the project.

I am now waiting for your feedback or further instructions.
